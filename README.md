Code for structural equation modeling based on the summary statistics obtained from genome wide association studies (GWAS). The wiki pages on this github contain documentention on the use of the package. Untill explicitly stated otherwise the code on this github in an alpha version (0.0.1) and under active development. The code may thus produce undesired results on certain operating systems or when run concurrently with specific packadges or R versions. Feel free to raise issues if (or when...) the package produces undesired results, we will attempt to swiftly deal with known issues. Please visit the wiki for tutorials on how to use the package.
